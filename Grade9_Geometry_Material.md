# Grade 9 Geometry – Perimeter, Area, and Volume (Alberta Curriculum, Calgary)

This lesson expands on our earlier work in Geometry, focusing on **formulas and practice problems**.

## Part A: Key Formulas

### Perimeter (2D)
- Rectangle: P = 2(l + w)
- Square: P = 4s
- Triangle: P = a + b + c
- Circle (Circumference): C = 2πr

### Area (2D)
- Rectangle: A = lw
- Square: A = s²
- Triangle: A = 1/2 × b × h
- Parallelogram: A = b × h
- Trapezoid: A = 1/2 × (a + b) × h
- Circle: A = πr²

### Volume (3D)
- Rectangular Prism: V = l × w × h
- Cube: V = s³
- Cylinder: V = πr²h
- Cone: V = 1/3 × πr²h
- Sphere: V = 4/3 × πr³
- Pyramid: V = 1/3 × (Base Area) × h

## Part B: Practice Problems

### Perimeter & Area of 2D Shapes
1. Find the perimeter and area of a rectangle with length 12 cm and width 8 cm.  
2. A square has side length 15 cm. Find its perimeter and area.  
3. A triangle has base 10 cm and height 6 cm. Find its area.  
4. Find the circumference and area of a circle with radius 7 cm.  
5. A trapezoid has bases 8 cm and 12 cm, and height 5 cm. Find its area.  

### Volume of 3D Shapes
6. Find the volume of a rectangular prism with length 10 cm, width 6 cm, and height 4 cm.  
7. A cube has side 5 cm. Find its volume.  
8. A cylinder has radius 3 cm and height 10 cm. Find its volume.  
9. A cone has radius 6 cm and height 9 cm. Find its volume.  
10. A sphere has radius 7 cm. Find its volume.

## Part C: Answer Key

### Perimeter & Area
1. Rectangle: P = 2(12+8) = 40 cm, A = 12×8 = 96 cm²  
2. Square: P = 4×15 = 60 cm, A = 15² = 225 cm²  
3. Triangle: A = 1/2 × 10 × 6 = 30 cm²  
4. Circle: C = 2π×7 ≈ 43.98 cm, A = π×7² ≈ 153.94 cm²  
5. Trapezoid: A = 1/2 × (8+12) × 5 = 50 cm²  

### Volume
6. Rectangular Prism: V = 10×6×4 = 240 cm³  
7. Cube: V = 5³ = 125 cm³  
8. Cylinder: V = π×3²×10 = 90π ≈ 282.74 cm³  
9. Cone: V = 1/3 × π×6²×9 = 108π ≈ 339.12 cm³  
10. Sphere: V = 4/3 × π×7³ ≈ 1436.76 cm³
