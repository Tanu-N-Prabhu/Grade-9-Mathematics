# Day 4: Pythagoras' Theorem

## Objective
By the end of this session, Owen will:
- Understand and apply **Pythagoras’ Theorem** to find missing side lengths in right-angled triangles.
- Solve both numerical and word problems.
- Practice problems aligned with the Alberta Grade 9 Math Curriculum.

---

## Lesson Notes

### 1. What is Pythagoras' Theorem?
In a **right-angled triangle**:
\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

Where:
- **a, b** = the two legs (shorter sides)
- **c** = the hypotenuse (longest side opposite the right angle)

---

### 2. Steps to Apply the Theorem
1. Identify the sides (legs vs. hypotenuse).
2. Substitute values into the formula.
3. Solve for the unknown side.
4. Double-check with squaring.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Find the hypotenuse
A right triangle has legs of 3 cm and 4 cm.  
Find the hypotenuse.

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]  
\[ 3^2 + 4^2 = c^2 \]  
\[ 9 + 16 = c^2 \]  
\[ 25 = c^2 \]  
\[ c = 5 \]  

**Answer:** Hypotenuse = 5 cm

---

### Example 2: Find a missing leg
Hypotenuse = 13 cm, one leg = 5 cm.  
Find the other leg.

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]  
\[ a^2 + 5^2 = 13^2 \]  
\[ a^2 + 25 = 169 \]  
\[ a^2 = 144 \]  
\[ a = 12 \]  

**Answer:** Other leg = 12 cm

---

## Practice Problems

### Part A: Find the Hypotenuse
1. a = 6, b = 8  
2. a = 9, b = 12  
3. a = 7, b = 24  
4. a = 15, b = 20  

### Part B: Find the Missing Leg
5. c = 10, a = 6  
6. c = 25, b = 24  
7. c = 17, a = 8  
8. c = 29, b = 21  

### Part C: Word Problems
9. A ladder is leaning against a wall. The bottom is 9 m away from the wall, and the ladder is 15 m long. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?  
10. A rectangular TV has a width of 16 inches and a diagonal of 20 inches. What is its height?  

---

## Answer Key

### Part A: Hypotenuse
1. c = \( \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64} = 10 \)  
2. c = \( \sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{81 + 144} = 15 \)  
3. c = \( \sqrt{7^2 + 24^2} = \sqrt{49 + 576} = 25 \)  
4. c = \( \sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = \sqrt{225 + 400} = 25 \)  

### Part B: Missing Leg
5. b = \( \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = 8 \)  
6. a = \( \sqrt{25^2 - 24^2} = \sqrt{625 - 576} = 7 \)  
7. b = \( \sqrt{17^2 - 8^2} = \sqrt{289 - 64} = 15 \)  
8. a = \( \sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \sqrt{841 - 441} = 20 \)  

### Part C: Word Problems
9. Height = \( \sqrt{15^2 - 9^2} = \sqrt{225 - 81} = 12 \) → Ladder reaches **12 m** up the wall.  
10. Height = \( \sqrt{20^2 - 16^2} = \sqrt{400 - 256} = 12 \) → TV height = **12 inches**.

✅ By the end of this session, Owen should be able to confidently apply **Pythagoras' Theorem** to solve numerical and real-world problems.
