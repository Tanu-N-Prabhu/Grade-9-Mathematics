# 📘 Day 6 – Algebra: Linear Equations

## 🎯 Session Goals
- Understand how to solve **linear equations** in one variable.  
- Apply equations to **real-life word problems**.  
- Learn step-by-step problem-solving strategies.

---

## 📝 Key Concepts

A **linear equation** is an equation where the variable is to the first power:

ax + b = c

Where:
- x = unknown variable  
- a, b, c = constants  

### Steps to Solve:
1. Simplify both sides of the equation.  
2. Move constants to one side.  
3. Divide by the coefficient of the variable.  
4. Check your solution by substituting back.

## 🔹 Part A: Simple Equations

1. Solve: 2x + 5 = 13  
2. Solve: 7x - 4 = 24  
3. Solve: 5x + 3 = 2x + 12  
4. Solve: 3(x - 2) = 12  
5. Solve: 4(x + 5) - 3 = 21

## 🔹 Part B: Word Problems

### Problem 1: Movie Tickets
The cost of a movie ticket is x. If 5 tickets cost 60, find x.

### Problem 2: Age Problem
John is 3 years older than twice the age of his sister. If John is 17, how old is his sister?

### Problem 3: Money Sharing
Alice and Bob share 120. Alice gets 20 more than Bob. How much does each get?

### Problem 4: Distance Problem
A car travels at x km/h. It takes 3 hours to cover 180 km. Find x.

### Problem 5: School Supplies
A pack of pens costs p. If 7 packs cost 42, find the cost of one pack.

## ✅ Answer Key

### Part A
1. 2x + 5 = 13 → 2x = 8 → x = 4  
2. 7x - 4 = 24 → 7x = 28 → x = 4  
3. 5x + 3 = 2x + 12 → 3x = 9 → x = 3  
4. 3(x - 2) = 12 → 3x - 6 = 12 → 3x = 18 → x = 6  
5. 4(x + 5) - 3 = 21 → 4x + 20 - 3 = 21 → 4x + 17 = 21 → 4x = 4 → x = 1

### Part B
1. 5x = 60 → x = 12 ✅ Each ticket costs 12  
2. 2y + 3 = 17 → 2y = 14 → y = 7 ✅ Sister is 7 years old  
3. a = b + 20, a + b = 120 → (b+20)+b=120 → 2b = 100 → b=50, a=70 ✅ Alice 70, Bob 50  
4. 3x = 180 → x = 60 ✅ Speed = 60 km/h  
5. 7p = 42 → p = 6 ✅ One pack costs 6

## Quick Tip
- Always perform **same operations on both sides**.  
- Check your answers by **substituting back** into the original equation.  
- For word problems, **define the variable clearly** first.
