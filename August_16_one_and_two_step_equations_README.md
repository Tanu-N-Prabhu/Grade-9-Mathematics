# Day 3
_Solving One-Step and Two-Step Equations_
**Grade 9 Alberta Curriculum – Calgary Focus**

## Objectives
By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to:
- Understand the concept of solving for an unknown.
- Solve one-step equations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
- Solve two-step equations by applying the correct inverse operations in sequence.

## Warm-Up (10 min)
Simplify each expression before solving:
1. `5 + 7`
2. `15 − 8`
3. `4 × 3`
4. `12 ÷ 4`
5. `3x + 2` when `x = 4`

---

## Lesson Notes (20 min)

### **1. Solving One-Step Equations**
- To **solve** an equation means to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true.
- Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other.

**Examples:**
1. `x + 5 = 12`  
   Subtract 5 from both sides:  
   `x = 7`
2. `3y = 15`  
   Divide both sides by 3:  
   `y = 5`

---

### **2. Solving Two-Step Equations**
- First, undo addition/subtraction, then undo multiplication/division.

**Example:**
1. `2x + 3 = 11`  
   Subtract 3: `2x = 8`  
   Divide by 2: `x = 4`

---

## Guided Practice (15 min)
Solve together:

1. `x + 7 = 12`
2. `y − 4 = 6`
3. `5a = 25`
4. `m ÷ 3 = 9`
5. `2x + 5 = 13`
6. `4y − 2 = 14`

---

## Independent Practice (10 min)
Solve on your own:

1. `x − 9 = 5`
2. `7a = 35`
3. `n ÷ 4 = 7`
4. `3x + 2 = 14`
5. `5y − 3 = 12`

---

## Challenge Question (5 min)
Solve: `4(x − 2) = 12`

---
