# ðŸ“˜ Day 6: Linear Equations & Geometry Applications  

## 1. Linear Equations Refresher  

A **linear equation** is any equation that makes a straight line when graphed.  

**Standard form:**  
y = mx + b  

- m = slope (rise over run)  
- b = y-intercept (point where the line crosses the y-axis)  

**Example:**  
Solve for y:  
2x + y = 10  

**Solution:**  
y = -2x + 10

## 2. Solving Linear Equations (Step by Step)  

**Example 1:**  
Solve:  
3x + 7 = 19  

**Solution:**  
3x = 12  
x = 4  

**Example 2:**  
Solve:  
2(x - 5) = 8  

**Solution:**  
2x - 10 = 8  
2x = 18  
x = 9

## 3. Geometry Connection: Perimeter & Algebra  

**Problem 1:**  
A rectangle has length 3x and width x + 2.  
If its perimeter is 20, find x.  

**Solution:**  
Perimeter formula: P = 2L + 2W  

20 = 2(3x) + 2(x+2)  
20 = 6x + 2x + 4  
20 = 8x + 4  
16 = 8x  
x = 2  

So, length = 6, width = 4 âœ…

## 4. Practice Questions (Owenâ€™s Turn ðŸš€)  

1. Solve: 5x - 3 = 2x + 9  
2. Solve: 4(x + 2) = 3x + 14  
3. A rectangle has length 2x + 1 and width x + 3.  
   If its perimeter is 26, find x, length, and width.  
4. A triangle has sides x, x+1, and x+2.  
   If its perimeter is 24, find x.

## 5. Answer Key âœ…  

1.  
5x - 3 = 2x + 9  
3x = 12  
x = 4  

2.  
4x + 8 = 3x + 14  
x = 6  

3.  
26 = 2(2x+1) + 2(x+3)  
26 = 4x + 2 + 2x + 6  
26 = 6x + 8  
18 = 6x  
x = 3  

Length = 7  
Width = 6  

4.  
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 24  
3x + 3 = 24  
3x = 21  
x = 7  

So sides are 7, 8, 9 âœ…
