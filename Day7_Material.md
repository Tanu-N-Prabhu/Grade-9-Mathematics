# Day 7: Surface Area & Volume of 3D Shapes

## Objective
- Understand and apply formulas for **surface area** and **volume** of common 3D shapes.  
- Solve word problems related to real-life contexts (boxes, cans, spheres).  

---

## Key Formulas

1. **Rectangular Prism (Box)**
- Volume = length × width × height  
- Surface Area = 2(lw + lh + wh)  

2. **Cube**
- Volume = side³  
- Surface Area = 6 × side²  

3. **Cylinder**
- Volume = π × r² × h  
- Surface Area = 2πrh + 2πr²  

4. **Sphere**
- Volume = 4/3 × π × r³  
- Surface Area = 4πr²  

5. **Cone**
- Volume = 1/3 × π × r² × h  
- Surface Area = πr² + πrl (l = slant height)

## Examples

### Example 1:
A box has dimensions 10 cm × 5 cm × 4 cm.  
- Find the volume.  
- Find the surface area.  

**Solution:**  
- Volume = 10 × 5 × 4 = 200 cm³  
- Surface Area = 2(10×5 + 10×4 + 5×4) = 2(50 + 40 + 20) = 220 cm²

### Example 2:
A sphere has radius 7 cm. Find its volume (use π = 3.14).  

**Solution:**  
- Volume = 4/3 × π × r³ = 4/3 × 3.14 × (7³)  
- 7³ = 343  
- Volume ≈ 4/3 × 3.14 × 343 ≈ 1436.76 cm³

## Practice Problems

1. A cube has side 6 cm. Find its volume and surface area.  
2. A cylinder has radius 4 cm and height 10 cm. Find its volume.  
3. A cone has radius 3 cm and height 8 cm. Find its volume (use π = 3.14).  
4. A sphere has diameter 10 cm. Find its surface area.  
5. A rectangular prism has dimensions 12 cm × 7 cm × 5 cm. Find its volume and surface area.

## Answer Key

1. Cube side = 6 cm  
- Volume = 6³ = 216 cm³  
- Surface Area = 6 × 6² = 216 cm²  

2. Cylinder r = 4, h = 10  
- Volume = πr²h = 3.14 × 16 × 10 ≈ 502.4 cm³  

3. Cone r = 3, h = 8  
- Volume = 1/3 × π × 9 × 8 ≈ 75.36 cm³  

4. Sphere d = 10, r = 5  
- Surface Area = 4πr² = 4 × 3.14 × 25 ≈ 314 cm²  

5. Rectangular Prism l = 12, w = 7, h = 5  
- Volume = 12 × 7 × 5 = 420 cm³  
- Surface Area = 2(12×7 + 12×5 + 7×5) = 2(84 + 60 + 35) = 358 cm²
