# Answer Key

## Section A

1.  10 cm (6² + 8² = 100 → √100 = 10)
2.  12 m (15² - 9² = 144 → √144 = 12)
3.  5 cm (13² - 12² = 25 → √25 = 5)
4.  50 inches (40² + 30² = 2500 → √2500 = 50)
5.  128.06 m (100² + 80² = 16400 → √16400 ≈ 128.06)
6.  10 cm (diagonal of square = s√2 → 10√2 = s√2 → s = 10)

## Section B

7.  13 km (5² + 12² = 169 → √169 = 13)

9.  29.15 m (25² + 15² = 850 → √850 ≈ 29.15)
10. 7 m (25² - 24² = 49 → √49 = 7)
11. 10 cm (6² + 8² = 100 → √100 = 10)
