# 🔹 Pythagoras’ Theorem – Extra Word Problems

### Problem 1: Ladder Against the Wall  
A ladder is leaning against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is **6 m** away from the wall, and the ladder reaches a height of **8 m**.  
How long is the ladder?

**Solution:**  
$$[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
]$$  
$$[
c^2 = 6^2 + 8^2
]$$  
$$[
c^2 = 36 + 64 = 100
]$$  
$$[
c = \sqrt{100} = 10 \, \text{m}
]$$  

✅ The ladder is **10 m** long.

### Problem 2: Diagonal of a Rectangle  
A rectangular park has a length of **12 m** and a width of **5 m**. Find the length of the diagonal.  

**Solution:**  
$$[
d^2 = l^2 + w^2
]$$  
$$[
d^2 = 12^2 + 5^2
]$$  
$$[
d^2 = 144 + 25 = 169
]$$  
$$[
d = \sqrt{169} = 13 \, \text{m}
]$$  

✅ The diagonal is **13 m**.

### Problem 3: Flying a Kite  
A boy flies a kite with a **100 m** string. If the kite is directly above a point **60 m** from where he is standing, how high is the kite?  

**Solution:**  
$$[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
]$$  
$$[
100^2 = 60^2 + h^2
]$$  
$$[
10000 = 3600 + h^2
]$$  
$$[
h^2 = 6400
]$$  
$$[
h = \sqrt{6400} = 80 \, \text{m}
]$$  

✅ The kite is **80 m** high.

### Problem 4: Distance Between Two Points  
Two friends start from the same point. One walks **9 km east**, the other walks **12 km north**. How far apart are they?  

**Solution:**  
$$[
d^2 = 9^2 + 12^2
]$$  
$$[
d^2 = 81 + 144 = 225
]$$  
$$[
d = \sqrt{225} = 15 \, \text{km}
]$$  

✅ They are **15 km apart**.

### Problem 5: Shadow of a Tree  
A tree casts a shadow **24 m** long. The tree is **18 m** tall. Find the distance from the top of the tree to the end of the shadow.  

**Solution:**  
$$[
d^2 = 18^2 + 24^2
]$$  
$$[
d^2 = 324 + 576 = 900
]$$  
$$[
d = \sqrt{900} = 30 \, \text{m}
]$$  

✅ The distance is **30 m**.
