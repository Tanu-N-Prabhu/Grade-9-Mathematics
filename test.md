## ✅ Answer Key

### Section A: Pythagoras’ Theorem
1. Hypotenuse = sqrt(6^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10 cm  
2. Height = sqrt(13^2 - 5^2) = sqrt(169 - 25) = sqrt(144) = 12 m  
3. Missing side = sqrt(15^2 - 9^2) = sqrt(225 - 81) = sqrt(144) = 12 m  
4. Side = diagonal / sqrt(2) = 14 / 1.414 ≈ 9.9 cm  
5. Distance = sqrt(60^2 + 80^2) = sqrt(3600 + 6400) = sqrt(10000) = 100 m

### Section B: Algebra – Linear Equations
1. 3x + 7 = 22 → 3x = 15 → x = 5  
2. 5x - 9 = 16 → 5x = 25 → x = 5  
3. 2(x + 4) = 18 → x + 4 = 9 → x = 5  
4. 2y + 4 = 20 → 2y = 16 → y = 8 ✅ Bob is 8 years old  
5. Speed = Distance / Time = 240 / 4 = 60 km/h

### Section C: Word Problems
1. Hypotenuse = sqrt(6^2 + 8^2) = 10 m. Perimeter = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24 m ✅ Verified  
2. Perimeter = 2(l + w) = 27 → l + w = 13.5  
   l = 2w + 3 → 2w + 3 + w = 13.5 → 3w + 3 = 13.5 → 3w = 10.5 → w = 3.5 → l = 2*3.5 + 3 = 10  
3. Height = sqrt(10^2 - 6^2) = sqrt(100 - 36) = sqrt(64) = 8 m
