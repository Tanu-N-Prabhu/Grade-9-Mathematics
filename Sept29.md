# Rational Numbers and Square Roots

## 1. Rational Numbers
- A **rational number** is any number that can be expressed as **p/q**,  
  where `p` and `q` are integers and `q ≠ 0`.
- Examples: 2/3, -5/7, 4, -9 (since 4 = 4/1, -9 = -9/1).

### Properties of Rational Numbers
1. **Closure:** If a and b are rational, then a + b and a × b are also rational.
2. **Commutativity:** a + b = b + a, and a × b = b × a.
3. **Associativity:** (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
4. **Distributivity:** a × (b + c) = a×b + a×c.

**Example 1:**  
Is 0.25 a rational number?  
- Yes, because 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4.

**Example 2:**  
Is √2 rational?  
- No, because √2 cannot be expressed as p/q with integers.

## 2. Square Roots
- The **square root** of a number `x` is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives `x`.
- Written as √x.  
- Example: √25 = 5 because 5 × 5 = 25.

### Perfect Squares
- Numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, … are called **perfect squares**.
- Their square roots are whole numbers.

**Example 3:**  
Find √144.  
- √144 = 12 because 12 × 12 = 144.

## 3. Approximating Square Roots
For numbers that are **not perfect squares**, approximate the square root.

**Example 4:**  
Find √50 to 2 decimal places.  
- 7² = 49 and 8² = 64 → √50 is between 7 and 8.  
- Using long division method or calculator: √50 ≈ 7.07.

## 4. Rationalizing Denominators
- To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by a suitable value to remove square root from denominator.

**Example 5:**  
Simplify 1/√3.  
- Multiply numerator and denominator by √3:  
  1/√3 × √3/√3 = √3/3.

## 5. Examples & Practice Problems

**Example 6:**  
Simplify √72.  
- √72 = √(36 × 2) = √36 × √2 = 6√2.

**Example 7:**  
Check if 0.333… is rational.  
- Yes, 0.333… = 1/3.

3. Simplify √98.  
4. Find √225.  
5. Rationalize: 5/√2.  
6. Approximate √45 to 2 decimal places.  
7. Which of the following are rational? (√49, √3, -8, 2.75)  
8. If √x = 15, find x.  
9. Express 0.6 as a rational number.  
10. Simplify √200.

### Answer Key
1. Yes, -7/11 is rational.  
2. 0.125 = 125/1000 = 1/8.  
3. √98 = √(49 × 2) = 7√2.  
4. √225 = 15.  
5. 5/√2 = 5√2 / 2.  
6. √45 ≈ 6.71.  
7. Rational: √49 = 7, -8, 2.75 = 11/4; Irrational: √3.  
8. √x = 15 → x = 225.  
9. 0.6 = 6/10 = 3/5.  
10. √200 = √(100 × 2) = 10√2.
