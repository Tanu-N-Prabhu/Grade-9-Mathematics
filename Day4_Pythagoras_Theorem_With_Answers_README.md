# Day 4: Pythagoras’ Theorem

## Objective
Understand and apply **Pythagoras’ Theorem** to solve problems involving right-angled triangles.

---

## Key Concept

Pythagoras’ Theorem states:

**For any right-angled triangle:**

$$[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]$$

Where:
- \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs (shorter sides),
- \(c\) is the hypotenuse (longest side).

To solve for a missing side:

$$[ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ]$$

$$[ a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2} ]$$

$$[ b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2} ]$$

---

## Example

A right triangle has legs 3 cm and 4 cm. Find the hypotenuse.

$$[ c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 ]$$

✅ The hypotenuse is **5 cm**.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1
A right triangle has sides 5 cm and 12 cm. Find the hypotenuse.

### Question 2
The hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13 cm, and one side is 5 cm. Find the other side.

### Question 3
A ladder is leaning against a wall. The ladder is 10 m long, and the bottom is 6 m from the wall. How high up the wall does it reach?

### Question 4
Find the missing side:
- Right triangle with sides 8 cm and 15 cm.

### Question 5 (Challenge)
A square has a diagonal of 10 cm. Find the length of each side.

## Answer Key

**Q1:**  
$$[ c = \sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{25 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13 ]$$ 
✅ Hypotenuse = **13 cm**  

**Q2:**  
$$[ a = \sqrt{13^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{169 - 25} = \sqrt{144} = 12 ]$$  
✅ Missing side = **12 cm**  

**Q3:**  
$$[ h = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8 ]$$  
✅ The ladder reaches **8 m high**  

**Q4:**  
$$[ c = \sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{64 + 225} = \sqrt{289} = 17 ]$$ 
✅ Hypotenuse = **17 cm**  

**Q5:**  
In a square, diagonal $$(d = \sqrt{2} \times \text{side})$$.  
$$[ 10 = \sqrt{2} \times s ]$$ 
$$[ s = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2} \approx 7.07 ]$$
✅ Each side ≈ **7.07 cm**

## Quick Tip
- Always check if the triangle is a right triangle before applying Pythagoras’ theorem.
- Remember: The hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle and is the **longest side**.
